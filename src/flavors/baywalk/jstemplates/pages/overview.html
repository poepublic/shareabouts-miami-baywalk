<h1>Activate the Baywalk</h1>

<p>The Miami Baywalk is currently a disconnected and unknown pedestrian path/public space
stretching over 4 miles along Biscayne Bay.  It is underutilized during the day and even more so at
night.</p>

<p>We at the Miami Downtown Development Authority (DDA) are investing $25,000 to activate and
energize the Baywalk with YOUR ideas.  Any individual or organization can apply, and any site along
the Baywalk is open to your proposal.  We will work with you to make your event a reality.</p>

<p>The Baywalk needs people, families, music, culture, food, dancing, games, art, sports, shade, green
space, lighting, water access, entertainment… and above all, life!  But, what do you think is missing? 
How will you activate the Baywalk?</p>

<p>Get started by picking a site and telling us your idea.  Watch your idea and the Baywalk come to life!</p>
