<h1>{{#_}}Activate the Baywalk{{/_}}</h1>

<p>{{#_}}Through the Baywalk Activation Mini-Grant program, we are investing $25,000 to activate and energize the Baywalk with YOUR ideas.  Any individual or organization can apply for grants from $500 up to $5,000, and any site along the Baywalk is open to your proposal.  We will work with you to make your event a reality.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}The Baywalk needs people, involvement, attentionâ€¦ and above all, life!  What do you think is missing?  How will you activate the Baywalk?{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}Why are we doing this?  Because the Miami Baywalk is currently a disconnected and unknown pedestrian path/public space stretching over 4 miles along Biscayne Bay.  It is underutilized during the day and even more so at night.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}All entries are due by Friday, November 3, 2017.  So get started with your transformation by picking a site and telling us your idea.  Watch your idea and the Baywalk come to life!{{/_}}</p>
