<h1>Activate the Baywalk</h1>

<p>The Miami DDA is currently seeking proposals from interested and qualified consultant teams, to develop a Unifying Element &amp; Brand Identity for the Miami Baywalk-Riverwalk.</p>

<p>No other project on the waterfront has the potential of transforming our Downtown, celebrate Miami’s unique heritage, create access from our diverse neighborhoods to the waterfront, and generate a legacy for generations to come.</p>

<p>The data will be used for us to determine the best ideas for bringing more awareness and engagement of along the Baywalk. They can find more information by visiting the miamidda.com.  We have a special Baywalk section and will have more information uploaded soon.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support of the Downtown Baywalk.  We hope we get the opportunity to implement your great activation idea this Fall.  Winners of the Baywalk Activation Grants will be notified by November…</p>
