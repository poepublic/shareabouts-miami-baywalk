          <img src="/static/images/finalists/Building-the-Baywalk.jpg">
          <p class="description">Moonlighter Makerspace’s proposal puts the design of the Baywalk in the community’s hands, by allowing them to utilize oversized, modular (lego-like) blocks to envision and prototype what they&#39;d like to see on the Baywalk. They can build art, furniture, event spaces, vendor booths, playgrounds, or anything they can imagine. Community designers will lead them in a collaborative exercise to imagine the future of the Baywalk in a monthly event for 6 months.</p>

          <p class="description">Using the FEC slip as a floating stage and the Baywalk theater for an interactive installation. The installation would be light based, where visitors could engage with the installation through an app on their phone. They would then &quot;hack&quot; the installation to create their own light show on a nightly basis taking turns into lighting up the FEC slip. The installation would be a simple configuration but allow for various results that would allow for visitors to experience the setting in multiple different ways.</p>

          <p class="description">The purpose is to make art more accessible to all by taking it outside the museum walls. From Bayfront Park to Museum Park. PAMM will provide ornately framed, full-scale, high-quality reproductions of world-class contemporary art normally only seen inside a museum. Way- finding symbols will guide people along the Baywalk, connecting two major park spaces set against the backdrop of Biscayne Bay. (Staff recommends funding less than full budget).</p>
